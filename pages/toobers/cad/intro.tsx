      <h2>Time for CAD</h2>
      <p>
        It's almost time to get CADing, so you will need to have Fusion 360 installed by your lab this week. The license
        approval process with Autodesk's third party verifier may take a day, so please start the process now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wednesday evening, before lab, you will be invited to the 2.00b Fusion 360 workspace which will include space
        for each team, and the instructions for how to access the Toobers CAD model and how to work with it will be
        posted.

      <p className={'important'}>
        Submitting your MIT ID <strong>will not work</strong> for proof of student status since there is no date on the
        ID. We recommend sending a screenshot of your current class schedule from WebSIS. Be sure it has your name and a
        date this spring on it!
