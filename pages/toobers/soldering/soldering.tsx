      <h1>Now Soldering!</h1>
      <h2>Time to get Heated!</h2>
      <p>
        Make sure your table is clear of any unnecessary clutter, and let's get
        ready to solder!
      </p>
      <GuideVideo src="clear-your-table.mp4" />
      <p>
        Turn your soldering irons on. These are particularily fancy and have a
        temperature adjust - turn the knob so it shows 750&deg;F. The
        temperature should slowly rise until it reaches that. This should be
        obvious, but hear me out: the soldering iron is going to be{' '}
        <strong>hot</strong> ðŸ”¥. Be careful where you point that thing. Always
        leave it in the holder when not used. That holder may also be hot.
      </p>
      <h2>Tinning the Tip</h2>
      <p>
        To maintain a good soldering tip, you'll need to clean it periodically.
        You'll know when it's time to clean your tip when it starts oxidizing,
        or is no longer as shiny as it once was.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two ways to clean the tip. These soldering irons have both of
        them built into their handy little stand, so it's up to what works for
        you (or a combination of both).
      </p>
      <h2>Wet Sponge</h2>
      <p>
        Wet the sponge in the sink. Apply a bit of solder to the tip (if the
        solder isn't melting, give it a few seconds to heat up.) After a minute
        or two the iron should be hot enough to steam when touched to the
        sponge, and you should hear a satisfying sizzling sound. Wipe the tip on
        the sponge. The goal is to{' '}
        <strong>remove old and excess solder from the tip.</strong>
      </p>
      <GuideVideo src="wet-sponge.mp4" />
      <h2>Brass Sponge</h2>
      <p>
        A brass sponge works much like a regular sponge, except there's no need
        to worry about the tip becoming cooler as the brass sponge is not wet.
        Apply a bit of solder to the tip, and then just push your soldering tip
        up and down into the brass sponge. As with before the goal is to remove
        old and excess solder from the tip.
      </p>
      <GuideVideo src="brass-sponge.mp4" />
      <p>
        Now that your tip is properly tinned, you can start soldering.{' '}
        <strong>Periodically while you are working</strong>, clean and re-tin
        the tip. Tinning improves conductivity and makes soldering quicker and
        easier.
      </p>
      <h2>Soldering the JST-XH Connectors</h2>
      <p>
        We're going to be soldering JST-XH connectors to both the charging
        circuit and the power toggle switch.{' '}
        <strong>
          note how they are different than the connectors for the speaker
        </strong>{' '}
        (the Molex ones we discussed{' '}
        <a href="/toobers/breadboarding/audio#molex">in the audio section</a>).
      </p>
      <GuideImage

      />
      <p>
        Let's start with the charging circuit. Put the wires into the through
        holes in the charging circuit board, noting where the red and the black
        wires go respectively. Flip it around to the other side (you can bend
        the wires over a little on the other side to keep it in place)
      </p>
      <GuideImage
        src={[
          '/images/toobers/closeup-charging-circuit.jpg',
          '/images/toobers/bend-wires-over.png',
        ]}
        border={false}
        size={'MEDIUM'}
      />
      <p>
        Hold the soldering iron tip to where the contact of the component meets
        the exposed wire. Next, take the spool of solder, and touch some solder
        gently to the contact of the component. You should see a very nice cone
        form between the contact of the component and the wire.
      </p>
      <GuideVideo src={'/soldering-charging-circuit.mp4'} />
      <p>
        Inspect your solder. Make sure the solder has good contact between the
        wire and the soldering pad.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        In general, after you solder, you should always take a moment and make
        sure there's no unwanted bridges/connections between adjacent pins,
        especially if you don't fully trust your soldering skills yet. To do
        this, you can use the multimeter tool. Turn your multimeter on and set
        it to the diode/speaker symbol. Place the red and black probes in the
        slots as shown below:
      </p>
      <GuideImage
        src={'/images/toobers/continuity-test-multimeter.png'}
        border={false}
        size={'SMALL'}
      />
      <p>
        In this mode, the multimeter will make a beep if there is an electrical
        connection (continuity) between the two probes. You can also see the
        display show a 0 (or something close to 0) if it's a connection (no
        resistance). If there is an open circuit, you'll see a 1 digit on the
        far left.
      </p>
      <p>
        To test for unwanted connections in your circuit, hold up each probe to
        a pin. If it beeps, you probably have too much solder and will need to
        remove some before proceeding (in order to break the connection.)
      </p>
      <h2>Made a mistake?</h2>
      <p>
        No worries! Happens all the time. If you need to remove solder, grab the
        solder wick (or the de-soldering braid) and simply place the end of the
        wick over the solder you want to remove and then place your heated
        solder tip over it. The braid heats up and encourages the solder to wick
        up into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other (more fun) tool we have is a solder sucker, which is a mini
        mechanically powered vacuum that can suck the solder up when it's still
        molten and remove it from your work piece.
      </p>
      <GuideVideo src={'/solder-sucker.mp4'} />
      <p>
        (These are tools that you'll probably need to grab from the 'common'
        pile. Feel free to grab one to investigate.)
      </p>
      <h2>Repeat for Switch!</h2>
      <p>
        Go ahead and proceed to do this again but for the switch. Once again,
        pay attention to where the red wire goes and where the black wire goes.
      </p>
