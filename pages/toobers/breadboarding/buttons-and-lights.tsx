      <p>
        It's time to kick it up a notch! We'll be hooking up all four of the
        LEDs and buttons now. Because we're using the WS2812b LEDs, we can wire
        these up in series, with the data out <span className="pin">Dout</span>{' '}
        of one LED going into the data in <span className="pin">Di</span> of the
        next LED.
      </p>
      <p>The final inputs/outputs on the Arduino should be as follows</p>
      <p>
        <span className="pin">PIN 8</span> Red Button
        <br />
        <span className="pin">PIN 7</span> Green Button
        <br />
        <span className="pin">PIN 6</span> Blue Button
        <br />
        <span className="pin">PIN 5</span> Yellow Button
        <br />
        <span className="pin">PIN 4</span> WS2812b LEDs
      </p>
      <p>
        If you think you understand how you built the red LED and button, see if
        you can duplicate this setup 3 times. If you don't feel comfortable yet,
        don't worry - keep reading for a handy guide!
      </p>
      <p>Your result should look something like this:</p>

        In this photo, we used different colored wires, just to make it easier
        to identify. You can ask around for different colors of wire (we always
        have plenty extra). You can also use the jumper wires we provided you to
        save yourself some time when it comes to stripping wires.

      />
      <p>
        Remember to <strong>KEEP IT NEAT!</strong> notice that in our example,
        we press down as many of the wires as possible to the board so they're
        easy to follow. When building your final toy, you also want to keep
        wires as clean as possible. Messy wires are super hard to debug and
        figure out if something is wrong - and instructors have a much harder
        time helping you!

        build your circuit so it's identical to ours.

      <h2>Software for our Four New Friends</h2>
      <p>
        It's always good to test your wiring in stages. Once you have a lot of
        wires, it can be difficult to find what's wrong if there's a lot going
        on. Once again, for this, we've prepared some code for you to see if
        you've got all the LEDs and buttons wired up correctly.

        The correct behavior is: once you click on each button, the
        corresponding LED should blink twice! If it works, you're good to go!
