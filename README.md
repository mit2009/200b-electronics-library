# 2.00b Electronics Library

Hello! This is a companion website to Toy Product Design (2.00b) a Mechanical Engineering class that runs in the spring at MIT, with a focus on learning product design through building a toy product prototype. This simple one-page website has a list of recommended electronic components for students of the class.

The data is loaded from a private Google sheet. Contact Victor for access.

The website is built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and uses TypeScript.

## Setup And Development

1. Clone this repo!
1. Navigate to the root using Terminal on a Mac, or some sort of bash shell if youre on a PC. Run `yarn install` (if you don't have yarn, you may need to [install it](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable). Yarn is a package management system and makes keeping track of versions easy.)
1. Next, you'll need to get the `.env.local` files from someone currently who has the app running. Probably Victor. Place the `.env.local` in the root of the project.
1. To run the development server, run: `yarn dev`
1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
