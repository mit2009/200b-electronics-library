        The sugar cubes are attached to the Toober top housing via 2 screws.
        Looking top down, this is what we get:{' '}

      <p>
        If we look closely at just one button, we can see that the minimum area
        (in the X/Y plane) needed for one of these buttons is actually a
        combination of the acrylic plate and the PCB. If you choose to move the
        location of these lovely sugar cubes, you'll want to make sure that
        nothing interferes with the area that these sugar cubes sit in (see
        dotted line below.) Of course, another way to check is to import the
        sugar cube in to your model so you can both visually inspect if there's
        interference as well as to use the Fusion 360{' '}
        <strong>interference tool</strong> (which we'll show in a bit).

      <h2>Creating your own Sugar Cube Mount</h2>
      <p>
        First, determine which plane you'd like your button to be on. Ballpark
        if you'll have enough space for the button itself before proceedin. The
        rectangular, bounding box of the shape is roughly 36mm by 36mm. Your
        housing wall should be roughly 3mm thick. The buttons do stick out quite
        a bit so there is a bit of a buffer if you do make your walls thicker
        for some reason.
      </p>

        We'll focus on making one sugar cube mount for now, since once you make
        one, you can easily make 4 (either manually or with any of the
        patterning/duplication/mirroring tools).

      <ol>
        <li>
          Click the <strong>Create Sketch</strong> button, and create a 16mm by
          16mm square. Confirm the sketch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click the <strong>Extrude</strong> button. Make sure the operation is
          set to <strong>Cut</strong>. Extrude through the housing wall (either
          by an Extent Type Distance of wall thickness, or you can use the
          Extent Type: 'To Object' feature). Click <strong>OK</strong>. you
          should have a square hole in your housing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click the <strong>Fillet</strong> tool. Add a 2mm Fillet to the hole.
          This will give it the nice, rounded button shape for the sugar cube.
          Click <strong>OK</strong>.
