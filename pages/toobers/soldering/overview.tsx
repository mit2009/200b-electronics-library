      <h1>Soldering Overview</h1>
      <h2>Toobers, Assemble!</h2>
      <p>
        It's time to begin the process of assembling your Toobers toy into its final housing! Of course, you don't have
        the housing for your toy just yet, but we can start by taking our prototype toy (the breadboard circuit) and
        converting it into a more 'finalized' format.
      </p>

      <h2>Today's Product</h2>
      <p>
        This is what you'll end up with today. This is sometimes known as an <strong>Arduino Shield</strong>, a printed
        circuit board (PCB) component that can sit directly ontop of the Arduino.{' '}
        <strong>The long leads you see on the PCB go into the Arduino pins</strong>, and the board has connectors which
        allow us to later assemble and connect our components easier. Take a look below at what your end result will be.
      </p>

      <h2>Soldering</h2>
      <p>
        Soldering is the process of joining different types of metal together by melting a filler material (the solder).
        Solder is typically made of lead or lead-free alloys (which have low melting-points). We'll discuss the safety
        of soldering and soldering fumes in a later section.
      </p>

        alt="Close-up of Soldering"
      />
      <p>
        While soldering and welding both involve melting metal to join two or more work pieces, soldering is different
        from welding. Unlike welding, soldering does not involve melting the work pieces. In addition to electronics,
        soldering has applications in plumbing, flashing, metalwork, jewelry, musical instruments, etc.!
      </p>
      <h2>The Upgrades!</h2>
      <p>
        Before jumping into the hot stuff, let's take a look at what's going to be happening. We'll be condensing the
        form factor of our current toy into something more manageable. With that, we'll be soldering and permanently
        attaching parts so that wires and components don't accidentally fall out if the toy is shaken about. And lastly,
        we'll be making it so our Toobers doesn't use our computer as a power source, by adding a 9v battery
        (rechargeable!) and a toggle power switch.
      </p>
      <h2>Printed Circuit Board & Perfboards</h2>
      <p>
        Printed Circuit Boards (or PCBs) are everywhere in our world today. If you're using anything that involves
        electricity, it's likely that there's a PCB in the device. A PCB forgoes the wires in a breadboard circuit in
        exchange for <strong>traces</strong> - the network of conductive paths that make up a printed circuit board and
        connect the different components. Your components (like resistors, or buttons) are then soldered to this PCB.
      </p>
      <GuideImage removeMargin={true} border={false} size="LARGE" src="/images/toobers/404" alt="Anatomy of a PCB" />
      <p>
        While getting a professionally made PCB is relatively cheap and easy nowadays, you may not have a chance to
        design and make a PCB for this class, as the turnaround & shipping time for a PCB tend to not work very well
        with the milestones of this class. We also have tools in the PDL that helps with making your PCB, although that
        can also be time consuming.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what do we want to do if we want something more reliable than a breadboarded circuit in our final product? A
        reasonable solution is a 'perfboard'! A perfboard doesn't have traces, so you'll need to solder your own wires,
        but it still has the reliability and permanence of a printed circuit board.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alright, now that we understand that option, back to the PCB. Take a look at the PCB, and take a few seconds to
        identify all the different components that you'll attach to it. You may notice that we're missing locations for
        the resistors for the LEDs on the PCBs. That's because the buttons you have are extra special! Each arcade
        button is actually a button AND a LED with a built-in resistor.
