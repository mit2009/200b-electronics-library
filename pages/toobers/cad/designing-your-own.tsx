* Length/Width: how much was added in the length/width dimensions of the top half and bottom half. Whether protrusions may be printed as appendages (separately printed and then attached during assembly).

* Whether there were any other changes to the dimensions of the top and bottom halves.

* Buttons: whether or not there were any changes to button positions. If so, briefly describe change.

* Decals: whether or not any decals were used. If so, list of decals and where/how to position them (since staff will need to reapply). Don't forget to upload decals into Slack!

* Textures: whether any textures were applied. If so, which texture and where/how to position them.

* Transparency: Whether there is any transparency is any of the materials. If so, specify which parts are intended to be transparent, along with if they should be tinted with any color.

      <h1>Designing your own Case</h1>
      <h2>It's your turn!</h2>
      <p>
        Now that we've learned some of the fundamentals of our base Toober and
        developed some basic understanding of CAD, we have the opportunity to
        build on and explore these skills as we design our own case for our
        Toobers toy!
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the tools in this tutorial (or any others you may come across) and
        make modifications to your copy of the base Toobers design,{' '}
        <strong>showcasing your uniqueness and interests</strong>! There is no
        right or wrong way to start or finish this process - just make sure
        you're proud of the end result.
      </p>
      <p>We will be 3D-printing your designs in the coming weeks.</p>
      <h2>Base Constraints</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the base model, all the walls are around 3mm thick. Typically, it
          is good to maintain at least 2.5mm thickness on large wall sections.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may modify the button locations in the top piece, but please do
          not change the placement of components in the bottom piece or change
          the openings for the battery or power switch in the bottom piece.
          These are the <strong>hard points</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          For additions onto the body, they may not increase the overall length
          or width of the top or bottom piece by more than <strong>14mm</strong>{' '}
          in the X or Y direction. One way to think of this is to keep your
          design within 7mm from all sides, but the available{' '}
          <strong>14mm</strong> buffer can be split along each axis in whichever
          manner you wish.
        </li>
        <li>
          The top housing may have up to a <strong>7mm</strong> increase in
          overall height.
        </li>
        <li>
          The bottom housing may <strong>not change</strong> in height.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The image below contains dimensions of the existing base toober.</p>

        border={false}
      />
      <p>
        The green lines in the image below represents the bounding box to which
        your design can extend. Think of all the possibilities!

        border={false}
      />
      <h2>Additional Appendages and ProTOOBERances</h2>
      <p>
        You may design appendages that go on any of the faces that protrudes
        outside of than the allotted bounding box, but we will be printing them
        separately and then you will join them to the base cube shape. All such
        appendages should not be larger than{' '}
        <strong>104 x 50 x 25 mm each</strong>. If your design requires more
        than <strong>2 such appendages</strong> or additional printing capacity,{' '}
        <strong>

        to discuss your design, which will need to be approved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leave your appendages on your model. The 3D printing staff will
        carefully slice them up and add the necessary pins to join the pieces
        together, being mindful of locating features as well as strength of
        printed part. You will receive plenty of instructions and glue during
        the assembly party.
